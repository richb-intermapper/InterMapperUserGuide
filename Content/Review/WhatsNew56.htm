        <p>InterMapper <MadCap:variable name="Primary.CurrentVersionMajor" /> includes many new features and enhancements. Here's a summary...</p>
        <h3>Web server identification</h3>
        <p>InterMapper identifies an HTTP server during auto-discovery, and creates a probe groups automatically to monitor it.</p>
        <h3>ARP discovery</h3>
        <p>InterMapper uses the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table to find additional devices during auto-discovery, broadening its view of the network.</p>
        <h3>UI Enhancements</h3>
