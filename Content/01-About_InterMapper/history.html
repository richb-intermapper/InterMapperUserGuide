            <MadCap:keyword term="NT" />A Brief History of InterMapper</h1>
        <p>InterMapper<sup>®</sup><MadCap:keyword term="IP" /><MadCap:keyword term="SNMP" /><MadCap:keyword term="AppleTalk" /><MadCap:keyword term="Rich Brown" /><MadCap:keyword term="SNMP-speaking" /><MadCap:keyword term="NED" /> is a network monitoring and alerting tool. It was 
	initially developed at Dartmouth College where Bill Fisher and Rich Brown 
	worked to create a tool that would monitor the College's locally-developed 
	New England Digital (NED) AppleTalk and IP routers. These minicomputer-based 
	routers had extremely limited memory, and thus couldn't ever be programmed 
	to speak SNMP. With more than one hundred of these routers in the basements 
	of buildings on campus, the College decided to write its own tool for monitoring 
	the network. As more SNMP-speaking commercial equipment was brought on campus, 
	InterMapper was extended to support SNMP, and later other probe types.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="MacPing" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="MacPing:selling" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="SNMP Watcher" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="SNMP Watcher MIB" />The program was good enough that Rich and Bill were encouraged to market 
	InterMapper commercially beginning in July 1996. (They had some practice marketing 
	software from their experience selling the MacPing software from 1992.) Dartmouth 
	also began selling their SNMP Watcher MIB console in March 1999.</p>
        <p>In April, 2000, Dartmouth College transferred title to InterMapper, MacPing, 
	and SNMP Watcher to a newly-formed company, Dartware, LLC. The founders were 
	Rich Brown, Bill Fisher, and Stuart Pompian, an area businessman. Dartmouth 
	College retains a share of the ownership of Dartware which will continue development 
	and marketing of those software products. New to the InterMapper team are 
	Tex Clayton, programmer, and John Sutton, Customer Service.</p>
        <p>In July 2000, Dartware released InterMapper 3.0. In July 2001, we introduced 
	version 3.5. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="InterMapper Remote" />January 2002 introduced InterMapper 3.6, which was the first version to support 
	InterMapper Remote. Version 3.6.1 shipped in April 2002.</p>

	in version 4.1 in August 2003. InterMapper 4.2 brought Maintenance Mode, arithmetic 
	in probes, helper applications, and a number of miscellaneous changes in March 
	2004.</p>

        <p>InterMapper Flows 1.1 shipped in May 2009, bringing support for sFlow v2, 4, and 5, the ability to view data by bits or bytes per second, increased robustness on several platforms, and significant performance enhancements. This requires InterMapper 5.1 or newer.</p>
        <p>October 2009 saw the release of InterMapper Flows 1.2, which added Netflow v7 support, as well as JFlow support for Juniper equipment. It also provided a handy Whois lookup feature and the ability to copy graphs to a clipboard.</p>
