        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Down" />InterMapper treats an outage on each device interface as a separate alert 
	event. Each time an interface goes down, the device will go into alarm. The 
	device icon turns orange, and the affected interface gets a red "X". Any Alarm 
	notifications for that device are triggered. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="ACK" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="State/color" />You can right-click an affected interface's link, and select "Acknowledge". The device turns back to green (or its previous state/color), 
	the interface link gets a blue "X", and no further notifications 
	for that device are sent. InterMapper also writes a line in the Event Log 
	file for these events. The format of the Event Log entries is: </p><pre class="code">09/30 14:03:32 link DOWN : [1] switch.example.com - 1
...
09/30 14:03:49 link ACK : [1] switch.example.com - 1
</pre>
        <p>If another interface subsequently goes down, the same process repeats: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> the device turns orange
</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="EventLog file" /> an entry is written to the Event Log file
</li>
            <li> the affected interface gets a red "X"
</li>
            <li> notifications are sent
</li>
            <li> you can acknowledge the new interface
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Unacknowledge" />If two interfaces go down more or less simultaneously, a single set of alarm 
	notifications is sent. If you right-click to acknowledge one interface, the 
	device itself remains orange because it still has unacknowledged down interfaces. No further notifications will be sent. When all the 
	down interfaces have been acknowledged the device returns to its previous 
	state and color. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Status window" />Once acknowledged, a link's Status Window show the interface's 
	status as "ACK (down)". </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Interfaces window" />You can acknowledge and unacknowledge multiple interfaces from the device's 
	Interfaces Window. Select one or more interfaces in the list, and choose Acknowledge 
	or Unacknowledge. This has the same effect as doing each interface individually. 
  </p>
        <p>You can un-acknowledge a link by right-clicking on it. This replaces 
	the blue "X" with a red one, and re-enables any repeated notifications for 
	that device. </p>
        <p><b>Tip:</b> Choose from two methods of handling down interfaces. </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Acknowledge the interface as described above. This is good for outages on operational interfaces that are expected to return to service in the near future. </li>
            <li> If you know that an interface will be down for a long time, you can hide that
interface. This tells InterMapper not to monitor its status and removes it
from the map to minimize the visual clutter. To show or hide an interface, open
the device's Interfaces Window and check/uncheck the box in the left column. 
</li>
        </ol>
