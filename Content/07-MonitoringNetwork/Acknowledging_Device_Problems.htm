            <MadCap:keyword term="Monitor menu" />Use the Acknowledge command, available from the Monitor Menu, to 
 acknowledge failures or problems in the network. When you acknowledge 
 a problem, the InterMapper program does the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes the device's icon color to blue to show that 
 the problem has been acknowledged. </li>
            <li>Stops further notifications of the problem, either 
 for the duration of this outage, or for a specified time period. </li>

                <MadCap:keyword term="IP" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Enter" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Event Log file" />Writes any comment you enter into to the Event Log file, 
	 along with the name and IP address of the user who acknowledged the problem. 
	</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Status window" />Displays the comment in the device's Status Window.

            <MadCap:keyword term="Acknowledgements" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Remove:acknowledgement" />Why are Acknowledgements useful?</h2>
        <p>Acknowledgments allow the network administrator to see the state of 
 the network, as well as the responses that have been made to the current 
 set of problems. </p>
        <p>Use Acknowledgements to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Indicate that someone has 
	 taken responsibility for a problem</b> - Because acknowledging a problem 
	 turns the affected device's icon blue, it's easy to see that someone is 
	 aware of (and is presumably working on) the problem. </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Emphasize new problems</b> 
 - The normal color of icons on a map should be green (operating correctly) 
 or blue (having trouble, but being worked on.) When a new problem occurs, 
 the affected devices' color are red, orange or yellow, depending on the 
 severity. This makes it easy to see where new troubles lie. After acknowledgment, 
 these devices will also be blue. </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Suppress notification for 
	 a problem device </b>- When a device has been acknowledged, no further notifications 
	 are sent. </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Provide information about 
	 the problem and its management </b>- Enter a comment to convey information 
	 about the failure, and/or the corrective action. </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</b>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Basic Acknowledge" /> With timed and indefinite acknowledge, 
 you can acknowledge a device even when it is up and okay (i.e., green). 
 This is useful if you know that there may be future outages (for example, 
 planned maintenance) with the device, and you want to avoid extraneous 
 notifications. You cannot do this with Basic Acknowledge.</p>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</b> The presence of the wrench badge 
 is a safety measure. When you scan the map visually, the wrench indicates 
 devices whose notifications are currently being blocked.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Dependencies" />Acknowledgements and Dependencies</h2>
        <p>When you acknowledge a device, use the <b><i>Block notifications for 
 dependent devices </i></b>check box to specify whether the acknowledged 
 device should be considered in finding dependencies. Checking the box 
 suppresses notifications for any device "on the other side" 
 of the device being acknowledged. </p>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">To suppress notifications for all devices 
 that are dependent on the selected device:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the <b>Block notifications for dependent devices</b> 
 box. Notifications are suppressed for any device that depends on the selected 
 device.</li>
        </ul>
