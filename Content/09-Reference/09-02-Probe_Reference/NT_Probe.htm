            <MadCap:keyword term="XP Home:running" />InterMapper can monitor and send notifications for NT 
 Services running on another computer. InterMapper uses the Service Control 
 Manager facilities of the underlying Windows host to communicate with 
 a remote computer to track the state of its services.</p>
        <p><i style="font-style: italic;">Note:</i>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Unix:Unix/Linux" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="XP" /> This NT Services monitoring 
 is only available if the InterMapper server is running on a Windows XP, or 2003 computer. You cannot use this facility if you're using 
 a Macintosh or Unix/Linux computer to host the InterMapper server. </p>

        <p>The <b>NT Services</b> configuration window displays the full list of 
 services that are running on a remote host. You can check off one or many 
 services to monitor; InterMapper will then give an alert if any of them 
 fails. The parameters to the probe are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A list of <b>NT services</b><MadCap:keyword term="Stop" /> on the target machine. 
 This list has red and green marks to indicate whether the service is currently 
 running. Checking the box for the service will cause InterMapper to send 
 an alert if that service ever stops running.</li>
            <li>The <b><MadCap:keyword term="Username" /><MadCap:keyword term="User" /><MadCap:keyword term="Matches:username" />Username</b> and      <b><MadCap:keyword term="Password" />Password</b><MadCap:keyword term="Log On" /> required

            <MadCap:keyword term="Service Control Manager:opens" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="NT Services:open" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="SCM" />The NT Services probe opens the Service Control Manager (SCM) on the 
 target machine; hence, some authentication is required before this can 
 happen. There are several ways to do this.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Using built-in username and password:</b>
                <MadCap:keyword term="OK" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="NT Services:choose" /> 
 InterMapper has the built-in ability to solicit from you a username and 
 password for authentication. When you choose the NT Services probe, it 
 will prompt you for a username and password before attempting to connect 
 to the target machine. If you have not used one of the methods below, 
 fill in a username and password at that point and click OK. This will 
 be all you need to do for authentication; the username and password will 
 be saved. 
	
	<p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</b><MadCap:keyword term="Administrator" /> For this to work, 
 InterMapper must be running as an administrator, as only administrators 
 are empowered to make the required network connections. You can do this 
 in one of two ways: </p><ul><li><MadCap:keyword term="Properties" /><MadCap:keyword term="Browse" /><MadCap:keyword term="LocalSystem" /><MadCap:keyword term="Confirm Password" />The first way is by adjusting the account under 
 which InterMapper is run. InterMapper is normally installed under the 
 LocalSystem account, which does not have administrator privileges. To 
 change the account under which it runs, follow this procedure: Go into 
 the SCM and stop the InterMapper service if it is running. Right-click 
 and choose "Properties". Choose the "Log On" tab. 
 Under "Log On As...", click the radio button next to "This 
 account:", and click "Browse..." to list the accounts; 
 choose an account with administrator privileges. Fill in the password 
 for the account in "Password:" and "Confirm Password:". 
 Click "OK".</li><li><MadCap:keyword term="Administrator:Administrator's username" /><MadCap:keyword term="NT Services item" /><MadCap:keyword term="Server Settings list" />The second way is to let InterMapper be an administrator when it 
 needs to be by supplying it with an administrator's username and password, 
 so that it can elevate its privileges when it needs to. You can do this 
 using the NT Services item in the Server Settings list. 
		
		<b style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</b><MadCap:keyword term="Local Security Policy" /><MadCap:keyword term="Logon" /> In either scheme, the 
 administrator you supply must have been given the "Logon as a service" 
 right in the local security policy of the machine you are monitoring. <br /><br /></li></ul></li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;"><MadCap:keyword term="NET USE" />The NET USE command:</b> Another way 
 to authenticate is to use the NET USE command to create a connection between 
 the host machine and the target. For instance, to monitor the services 
 on a host at 192.168.1.140, enter the following: 
	
	<p><MadCap:keyword term="IP" />&#160;&#160;NET USE \\192.168.1.140\ipc$ /USER:Administrator</p><p><MadCap:keyword term="Username:prompted" />You will be prompted for the password, and the connection will be 
 made. (If you have done this, when prompted for a username and password 
 for NT Services by InterMapper, you can leave them blank and click OK.)</p><p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</b><MadCap:keyword term="DNS" /><MadCap:keyword term="DNS:see" /> You must use the IP address 
 and not the network name for the machine. That is important, as the Windows 
 OS will not see the DNS name or the domain name as being the same as 192.168.1.140 
 when checking the connections, and will not recognize that there is a 
 connection when InterMapper tries to query the services by IP address, 
 returning an "access denied" error instead. </p></li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;"><MadCap:keyword term="User:Synchronizing" /><MadCap:keyword term="Synchronizing" /><MadCap:keyword term="Synchronizing:Users" />Synchronizing Users:</b> A third way 
 to authenticate is to make sure that the user and password under which 
 the InterMapper service is running exists on the target machine as well. 
 
	
	<p>When InterMapper is first installed, it is installed running under 
 the user "LocalSystem", as most services are. It is necessary 
 to create a new user on your machine; let's name it <i>InterMapper</i> 
 and give it a password. Make sure it is a member of Administrators. (If 
 you already have a username and password that exist on all machines that 
 are to be targeted by the NT Services probe as well as the InterMapper 
 host and which has Administrator permissions everywhere, you can skip 
 the previous step and substitute it for      <i>InterMapper</i> in the following.)</p><p>Go into the SCM and stop the InterMapper service if it is running. 
 Right-click and choose "Properties". Choose the "Log On" 
 tab. Under "Log On As...", click the radio button next to "This 
 account:", and click "Browse..." to list the accounts; 
 choose <i>InterMapper</i>. Fill in the password for the account in "Password:" 
 and "Confirm Password:". Click "OK".</p><p>On the target machine, create a new user, also named <i>InterMapper</i>, 
 with the same password, and also a member of Administrators.</p><p><MadCap:keyword term="Start InterMapper" />Start InterMapper from the SCM on the original machine. You should 
 now be able to use NT Services probes. (When prompted for a username and 
 password for NT Services by InterMapper, you can leave them blank and 
 click OK.)</p></li>

        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="SCM:opening" />Windows XP uses a "simple" network scheme by default. In this 
 scheme, all remote connections are mapped to "guest", which 
 has very few permissions, as you might expect. This is the case even if 
 there are other authenticated connections between the two computers. This 
 default configuration prevents InterMapper from opening the SCM on a remote 
 Windows XP machine. Even with correct username and password information, 
 you will get an "access is denied" error.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="View" />

            <MadCap:keyword term="Start Menu-&gt;My Computer" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Apply" />To turn off this simplified networking: On the remote XP machine, choose 
 Start Menu-&gt;My Computer. In the window that opens, choose Tools-&gt;Folder 
 Options. Click the View tab. In the Advanced Settings list, scroll to 
 the bottom. Uncheck the box next to "Use simple file sharing (Recommended)". 
 Click Apply or OK. InterMapper should now be able to open the SCM on this 
 machine from afar if you've followed one of the methods above to provide 
 proper authentication.</p>

        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Windows Firewall" />If you have Windows XP SP2 or have installed your own firewall on the 
 target machine, you will need to make sure that there are holes in the 
 firewall for the probe. If you are using a default installation of Windows 
 XP SP2, then in the Windows Firewall settings, there is a probably a default 
 exception for File and Printer Sharing. If there is, you can simply check 
 this exception, and you will be done.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="TCP" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="UDP" />If there is not, or if you are using different firewall software, you 
 will need to add exceptions for port 137 (UDP), port 138 (UDP), port 139 
 (TCP) and port 445 (TCP).</p>
        <p>Note that if your host machine is Windows XP SP2 or has a firewall, 
 the same holes need to be open for NT Services probes to work.</p>
        <h2 class="pagebreakbefore">A Note on Error Messages</h2>
        <p>InterMapper may encounter authentication errors when attempting to connect. 
 Here is a list of the messages and ways you might work around them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Error attempting 
 to elevate privileges.</b>
                <MadCap:keyword term="NT Services:execute" />

                <MadCap:keyword term="Server Settings dialog" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Execute" /> InterMapper is not running as an administrator, 
 and thus needs to elevate its privileges in order to be able to execute 
 the NT Services probe. It could not do so. Make sure a correct username 
 and password for the InterMapper host machine have been supplied in the 
 NT Services panel of the Server Settings dialog. Make sure the user given 
 has the right to log on as a service in your Local Security Policy. If 
 host machine is Windows Server 2003 or newer, make sure the user has the 
 right to impersonate another user.</li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;"><MadCap:keyword term="Windows Networking" />Could not establish 
 Windows Networking connection to probe target.</b> When a username and 
 password have been supplied for the target machine, InterMapper attempts 
 to use them to create a connection between the host and the probe target. 
 This attempt failed for some reason. Will be followed by more specific 
 error information. See below.</li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Could not open SCM 
 on probe target.</b> InterMapper could not open the Service Control Manager 
 on the target machine. Will be followed by more specific error information.

            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Access is denied.</b>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Simple Networking" /> 
 Make sure InterMapper is running as an administrator, or that an administrator 
 username and password have been provided in the NT Services panel in the 
 Server Settings dialog. Make sure a valid administrator username and password 
 have been supplied for the probe target. If the probe target is running 
 Windows XP, make sure that "Simple Networking" is turned off.</li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">The network name 
 cannot be found.</b> and      <b>The network path was not found.</b> The device 
 you have specified does not appear to exist on the network. If you are 
 sure that it does, make sure it is a Windows machine with File and Print 
 Sharing turned on, and that any firewall has exceptions for File and Print 
 Sharing.</li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">An extended error 
 has occurred.</b>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Network-specific" /> A network-specific error has occurred. It should be 
 followed by more information about the nature of the error. You may need 
 to consult your network administrator.</li>
