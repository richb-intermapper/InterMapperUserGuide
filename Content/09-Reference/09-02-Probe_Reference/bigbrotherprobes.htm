        <p> InterMapper can act as a Big Brother server. <a href="http://www.bb4.com/download.html">Big 
 Brother</a><MadCap:keyword term="IP" /><MadCap:keyword term="Set:IP" /><MadCap:keyword term="Network Monitor" /> is a popular network monitoring tool that allows you to create scripts 
 ("clients") that run on remote systems and send status reports back to the Big 
 Brother server. This allows a network manager to test additional kinds of network 
 devices, either by writing scripts or using some of the many        <a href="http://www.deadcat.net">scripts 
 that are already available.</a></p>
        <p> When you specify a device to be tested with a Big Brother probe, InterMapper's 
 built-in Big Brother server listens for messages coming from a Big Brother client 
 on the corresponding machine. 
</p>
        <p>To configure Big Brother probe, you need to set two parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Port</b> - The default port is 1984, but you may choose a different port. If you choose a different port, 
 make sure that the Big Brother client on the corresponding machine is also configured 
 for the same port.
</li>
            <li><b>Purple Time</b> - This is the number of minutes to wait without a report before indicating a problem. In an actual Big Brother server, this is thirty minutes; Big Brother shows a device as purple if it goes this long without reports from the device. InterMapper shows it as DOWN (blinking red).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="IP:set" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Set" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="BBDISPLAY" /> In order for InterMapper to receive Big Brother messages from the remote client, 
 it must be configured correctly. In particular, the client must be configured 
 so that its BBDISPLAY is set to the IP address of the machine where InterMapper 
 is running.
</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Big Brother State" /> The Big Brother states will be mapped to InterMapper states as shown in the 
 table below: 
</p>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
            <col style="width: 185px;" />
            <col style="width: 265px;" />
            <tr>
                <th style="text-align: left;">Big Brother State</th>
                <th style="text-align: left;">
                    <MadCap:keyword term="InterMapper Status" />InterMapper Status</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Okay (green)</td>
                <td>Okay (green)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Attention (yellow)</td>
                <td>Warning (yellow)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Trouble (red)</td>
                <td>Critical (red)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p> At the moment, the only messages that InterMapper will process and represent 
 are "status" (and "combo") messages.
</p>
        <p> Note that the Big Brother server for a given port will not start until at 
 least one device has been configured for that port. Similarly, once the last 
 device for that port has been removed, the server for that port will shut down.
