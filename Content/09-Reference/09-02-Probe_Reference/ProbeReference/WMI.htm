<blockquote>
<p><b>WMI CPU Utilization</b> </p>
<p>This probe uses WMI to retrieve the percentage of time that a processor is executing a non-idle thread on the target host.  Specifically, it queries the PercentProcessorTime property of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_Processor class and compares it against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  Each processor is compared against the Single Warning and Critical parameters, and the total CPU utilization is compared with the Total Warning and Critical criteria.  Any of these values can be left blank if that check is not desired.</p>
<p>The target host must be running Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 or later.</p>
<p>The User parameter be a local user on the target host, or may take the form of "domain&#92;user" for a domain login.  Leave it blank if authentication is not required, such as when the target is the localhost.</p>
<p>InterMapper invokes the cpu_util.vbs companion script which was placed in the Tools folder of the InterMapper Settings folder when this probe was loaded.  It uses the exit value to set the condition of the device and the performance data returned by the script to create a nice display of chartable data.</p>

Specifically, it queries the Size and FreeSpace properties of the Win32_LogicalDisk class, computes percentage free space, and compares it against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  The target host must be running Windows 2000 or later.</p>
<p>The Drive parameter may be set to "All" to enumerate all Local hard drives on the host.  It may also be set to a list of comma-separated drive names (including the colon), which will be listed whether or not they are local hard drives.

<p>Wildcards (* ?) may be used in the filename.  If wildcards are used, be sure to specify the Path parameter or the query might take an inordinate amount of time.  At least one of the File or Path parameters must be set.</p>
<p>The Size parameter defines the minimum filesize criteria in bytes.  Any files larger than this value will be listed.  The Hours, Minutes and Seconds parameters combine to define how recently the file had to be changed to be listed.  These parameters are subtracted from the current time and used to select files based on their LastModified value.  At least one of these parametrs must be set.</p>

<p><b>WMI System Information</b> </p>
<p>This probe uses WMI to collect a variety of information about the monitored host including hardware and operating system details.  The target host must be running Windows 2000 or later.</p>
<p>The User parameter may be a local user on the target host, or may take the form of "domain&#92;user" for a domain login.  Leave it blank if authentication is not required, such as when the target is the localhost.</p>
<p>InterMapper invokes the system_info.vbs companion script which was placed in the Tools folder of the InterMapper Settings folder when this probe was loaded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>WMI Top Processes</b> </p>
<p>This probe uses WMI to retrieve information about CPU utilization and processes running on the target host.  Specifically, it queries the PercentProcessorTime property of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_Processor class and compares it against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  It queries the PercentProcessorTime property of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process class and lists up to five processes using the most CPU time.  Because there is a time lapse between collecting the CPU data and the process data, the reported values will not add up exactly.  The target host must be running Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 or later.</p>
<p>The User parameter may be a local user on the target host, or may take the form of "domain&#92;user" for a domain login.  Leave it blank if authentication is not required, such as when the target is the localhost.</p>
<p>InterMapper invokes the top_cpu.vbs companion script which was placed in the Tools folder of the InterMapper Settings folder when this probe was loaded.  It uses the exit value to set the condition of the device and the performance data returned by the script to create a nice display of chartable data.</p>
