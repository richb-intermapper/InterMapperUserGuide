            <MadCap:keyword term="Alarm" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="E-mail" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="E-mail:send" />You can attach one or more notifiers to any device. For each notifier, you 
	can choose which states trigger a notification to be sent. For example, a 
	particular device might have a notifier send an e-mail when a device goes 
	down, but can have a second notifier that plays sounds when the same device goes down, 
	comes up, or enters an alarm state. You might also send an e-mail to an on-site 
	system administrator during the day, and to a different administrator outside 
	business hours.</p>
        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">To attach a notifier to a device:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select one or more devices.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Monitor menu" />From the Monitor menu, choose <b><i><MadCap:keyword term="Notifiers window" />Notifiers Window</i></b><MadCap:keyword term="Notifier Settings window" />. 
	 The Notifier Settings window appears, containing the notifiers currently 
	 attached to the selected item as shown below.</li>
            <li>Select or clear the check boxes for the device states you 
	 want to trigger the notifier. A notification is sent when the device's state 
	 changes to any of the selected states. <br /></li>
        </ol>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Edit Notifiers" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Notifier List" /> You can create a new notifier from the Notifier Settings window. 
	The "Edit Notifiers..." button is a shortcut to the Notifier List 
	in the Server Settings page. </p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Repeat" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Count" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Delay" />Using the Delay, Repeat, and Count parameters</h2>
        <p><a name="rptdelay"></a>For each notifier, you can specify      <b>Delay</b>,      <b>Repeat</b>, 
	and      <b>Count</b> parameters. These parameters can be used 
	to control how quicky and how frequently notifications are sent. For example, 
	to avoid unnecessary pages you might configure a notifier to wait until a 
	device has been down for two minutes before sending the first page. You might also choose to re-send a notifier every 10 minutes forever. Notifications are sent until 
	the count is reached, or the device has been acknowledged.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Delayed Notifiers" />How Delayed Notifiers work</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Critical" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="OK" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="WARN" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="TRAP" />InterMapper maintains a queue of notifications to be sent. When a DOWN, WARN, 
	ALARM or CRITICAL event happens, InterMapper places a notification in the 
	queue, and sets its "time to be sent" according to the delay. (UP, 
	OK and Trap notifications are never delayed.)</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="UP/OK" />When an UP or OK event occurs, InterMapper first searches the notification 
	queue for the corresponding down, warn, or alarm notification. If it's there, 
	InterMapper removes both the DOWN (or Warn or Alarm) notification and UP (OK) 
	event and won't send either one. If not, then InterMapper sends the UP/OK 
	notification straight away.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Notification Escalation" />Notification Escalation</h3>
        <p>You can use notifiers to implement a problem escalation system by creating 
	two or more notifiers for a device. The first notifier can fire 
	quickly to alert someone immediately. A second notifier can be delayed for 
	a period of time, perhaps 30 minutes or an hour, before notifying a second 
	person. If the problem remains when the second notifier's delay time is reached, 
	the second notification is sent. As soon as a problem is acknowledged, no 
	further notifications are sent, even if the outage lasts a long time.</p>
