                <p>This probe uses WMI to retrieve the percentage of time that a processor is executing a non-idle thread on the target host.  Specifically, it queries the PercentProcessorTime property of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_Processor class and compares it against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  Each processor is compared against the Single Warning and Critical parameters, and the total CPU utilization is compared with the Total Warning and Critical criteria.  Any of these values can be left blank if that check is not desired.</p>

Specifically, it queries the Size and FreeSpace properties of the Win32_LogicalDisk class, computes percentage free space, and compares it against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  The target host must be running Windows 2000 or later.</p>
                <p>The Drive parameter may be set to "All" to enumerate all Local hard drives on the host.  It may also be set to a list of comma-separated drive names (including the colon), which will be listed whether or not they are local hard drives.

Specifically, it calls the DefragAnalysis method of the Win32_Volume class and reports pertinent statistics from the anaylsis.  If the drive needs tobe defragmented, warning status is set for the device.  The target host must be running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 or later.</p>

Specifically, it queries the Win32_NTLogEvent class, limiting the search with the parameters you set.  If matching events are found, a critical status is returned.  The target host must be running Windows 2000 or later.</p>
                <p>The Log File parameter contains a comma-separated list of the logs which are to be searched.  At least one Log File is required.</p>
                <p>The Event Codes parameter is a comma-separated list of event codes for which to search.  Leave it blank to select all codes.</p>
                <p>The Event Types paramaeter is a comma-seaprated list of either event type names or the corresponding numerical values.  Names and values can be intermixed.  This limits the selection to events of these types.</p>
                <p>The Hours, Minutes and Seconds parameters combine to define how far back in the event log to search.  These parameters are subtracted from the current time and used to select events based on when they were written to the log.</p>

                <p>Wildcards (* ?) may be used in the filename.  If wildcards are used, be sure to specify the Path parameter or the query might take an inordinate amount of time.  At least one of the File or Path parameters must be set.</p>
                <p>The Size parameter defines the minimum filesize criteria in bytes.  Any files larger than this value will be listed.  The Hours, Minutes and Seconds parameters combine to define how recently the file had to be changed to be listed.  These parameters are subtracted from the current time and used to select files based on their LastModified value.  At least one of these parametrs must be set.</p>

                <p>This probe uses WMI to retrieve performance information about the delivery queues on a MS Exchange 2007 Mailbox Server.  Specifically, it queries the Win32_PerfFormattedData_MSExchangeIS_MSExchangeIS, Win32_PerfFormattedData_MSExchangeIS_MSExchangeISMailbox, Win32_PerfFormattedData_MSExchangeIS_MSExchangeISPublic, Win32_PerfFormattedData_MSExchangeSearchIndices_MSExchangeSearchIndices classes to collect a variety of statistics and then compares them to the criteria you set.  The default criteria for warning and critical conditions are taken from the Microsoft TechNet article <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb201689.aspx">Monitoring Mailbox Servers</a>.</p>
                <p>The User parameter may be a local user on the target host, or may take the form of "domain\user" for a domain login.  Leave it blank if authentication is not required, such as when the target is the localhost.</p>
                <p>InterMapper invokes the ex07_mailbox.vbs companion script which was placed in the Tools folder of the InterMapper Settings folder when this probe was loaded.  It uses the exit value to set the condition of the device.</p>

                <p><b>WMI Network Utilization</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
                <p>This probe uses WMI to retrieve the network utilization on an interface on the target host.  Specifically, it queries the BytesTotalPersec, CurrentBandwidth, OutputQueueLength and PacketsReceivedErrors properties of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_Tcpip_NetworkInterface class.  It compares OutputQueueLength against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  The target host must be running Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 or later.</p>
                <p>The interface may be selected by IP Address, MAC Address, or Index.  You may use colons, hyphens or no separators when specifiying a MAC address.  The interface name is queried from the Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration class and used to query data from the Win32_PerfFormattedData_Tcpip_NetworkInterface class.</p>
                <p>The User parameter may be a local user on the target host, or may take the form of "domain\user" for a domain login.  Leave it blank if authentication is not required, such as when the target is the localhost.</p>

Specifically, it uses the Win32_PingStatus class to test the connectivity and returns a response time which is chartable.  If the target cannot be pinged, the status is set to critical and a discontiunity is inserted in the chart data.  The target host must be running Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 or later.</p>
                <p>Additional information about the monitored host is queried from the Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration and Win32_NTDomain classes and displayed in the status window.</p>

Specifically, it queries the PercentProcessorTime property of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_Processor class and compares it against the Warning and Critical parameters you set.  It queries the PercentProcessorTime property of the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process class and lists up to five processes using the most CPU time.
