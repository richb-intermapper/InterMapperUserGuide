            <h1 class="L2"><a name="kanchor2964"></a><a name="kanchor2965"></a>The InterMapper Settings Folder</h1>
            <p>The InterMapper Settings folder contains all the settings, preferences, 
 and configuration of InterMapper. The location of this folder varies, depending on your platform. For more information, see <a href="filesfolders.html">Files and Folders</a>.</p>
            <p>The InterMapper Settings folder contains the following items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Certificates folder</b> - 
 Contains certificates used by secure servers to verify that they are the 
 InterMapper servers they claim to be. Also contains key files and pending 
 certificate signing requests.</li>
                <li value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2966"></a>Chart Data folder</b> 
 - Contains the saved data of charts. When InterMapper starts up, 
 it reads the data from these files to restore the charts' history.</li>
                <li value="3"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2967"></a>Custom Icons folder</b> 
 - Contains custom icons you add to maps to enhance InterMapper's built-in 
 icon set. See               <a href="../../05-Arranging_Your_Map/Icons_On_Maps.html">Custom 
 Icons</a><a name="kanchor2968"></a> for details about making and adding custom icons.</li>
                <li value="4"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2969"></a>InterMapper Logs folder</b> 
 - Contains text files that log events that InterMapper has detected.</li>
                <li value="5"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2970"></a>InterMapper Prefs file</b> 
 - Contains the current settings of all InterMapper preferences.</li>
                <li value="6"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Maps folder</b> - Contains maps saved from InterMapper. All maps in this folder are opened automatically when you start InterMapper.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li value="1"><b>[Version Number] folder</b> - For each version of InterMapper that has been installed, (starting with 5.4) a new folder is created for each version. Maps from a previous version are copied into the new folder, which becomes the active maps folder. The folder for each new version contains a Disabled folder and a Deleted folder.
<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li value="1"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2971"></a>Enabled folder</b><a name="kanchor2972"></a><a name="kanchor2973"></a> 
						- Contains maps that have been disabled by removing the check mark in 
					the Map Files panel of the Server Settings window.</li><li value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2974"></a>Disabled folder</b><a name="kanchor2975"></a><a name="kanchor2976"></a> 
 - Contains maps that have been disabled by removing the check mark in 
 the Map Files panel of the Server Settings window.</li></ul></li><li value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2977"></a>Deleted folder</b>  - Contains maps that have been removed using the Map Files panel of the 
 Server Settings window.</li><li value="3"><b>Backups folder</b> - Contains backups created using the Backup command.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="7"><b>MIB Files folder</b> - Contains SNMP MIB files that ship with the product, or have
been added using the<b style="font-style: italic;">Import&#160;&gt;&#160;MIB...</b> command. InterMapper parses the MIB files in this folder and uses
the information to convert between variable names and OIDs.
</li>
                <li value="8"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Probes folder</b>- 
 Contains built-in and custom probes. Probes are text files that add functionality 
 to InterMapper so that it can test new devices. See Customizing InterMapper's 
 Probes for details about creating and customizing probes.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Built-in probes are stored in a ZIP&#160;archive named BuiltinProbes.zip. To view or modify a built-in probe, you'll need to unzip the archive. InterMapper scans the archive as well as the unzipped contents of the folder. If a built-in probe's filename matches an unzipped version, the probe's version number, then the last-modified date, is used to determine which probe is teh most recent. If you are developing or modifying a built-in probe, be sure to advance the version number to be sure that InterMapper uses the modified version.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Sounds folder</b><a name="kanchor2978"></a><a name="kanchor2979"></a> - 
 Add .aiff, .wav, and other sound files to this folder to make them 
 available for InterMapper notifications. For more information on sounds 
 and how to use them, see         <a href="../../06-Notifiers/06-01-ConfigNotifications/audible.html">Configuring 
 a Sound Notifier</a></li>
                <li value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2980"></a>Web Pages folder</b>  - Contains the template and target files that describe the web pages that the InterMapper server displays. See Customizing Web Pages for details  about customizing these pages.</li>
                <li value="3"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor2981"></a>InterMapper User List 
 folder</b> - Previous versions of InterMapper kept the user list in a 
 separate file. Now, these user and group settings have been incorporated 
 into the               <i>InterMapper Prefs</i> file. You may leave this file in place 
 without affecting InterMapper's operation.</li>
                <li value="4"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Tools folder</b> - 
 Contains executable files (or aliases/links/shortcuts to them) that will 
 be used as command-line probes or notifiers.</li>
                <li style="font-weight: normal;" value="5"><b>Fonts folder</b> - (optional) Contains TrueType fonts used by the web server.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> On Windows machines, the Windows font directory is also available, giving access to all available TrueType fonts installed on the machine. On Macs, InterMapper looks in <i>/Library/Fonts</i> and <i>/System/Library/Fonts</i>, as well as in the /InterMapper Settings/Fonts folder.</li>
                <li value="6"><b>Temporary folder</b> - When files are uploaded, they 
are initially uploaded and saved into this directory until 
the upload is complete. At that point, they are moved into a more 
appropriate directory. If something goes wrong, and an upload is 
interrupted, a file may remain in the "Temporary" directory.<br /><br />When you exit InterMapper, it leaves the files in the Temporary directory 
alone, so debugging information can be collected. 
When InterMapper starts up, it checks the Temporary directory, and deletes all files in it. Therefore, InterMapper users should not 
rely on the contents of the Temporary directory remaining long, and 
should not park files there.
