            </p>
            <!--h2>What is "dynamic AppleTalk and IPaddressing"?</h2>

<p>AppleTalk addresses are inherently dynamic. Every time an AppleTalk device 
  starts up, it may choose a different address on the network. IP addresses tend 
  to be more stable, but with the advent of server-based IP addressing schemes 
  (such as DHCP, BootP, MacIP, etc.), it's also possible that your IP address 
  could change every time you start up.</p>

<p>AppleTalk solves the problem of providing a stable service name for AppleTalk 
  devices by using the Name Binding Protocol (NBP). A client wishing to determine 
  the current address of some service sends a special probe to the zone where 
  the device is known to reside. Likewise, InterMapper periodically makes sure 
  that it is probing the right address and immediately rechecks if the device 
  goes down.</p>

<p>On the Internet, stable name identifiers are provided by the Domain Name System. 
  InterMapper periodically resolves a device's domain name to check for changes. 
  If it can't resolve the name to an address, it reports that the device is down. 
  The period for checking DNS names is derived from the TTL in replying DNR messages.</p-->

            <h2>My switches are always orange and showing lots of errors (or discards). 
 Why?</h2>
            <p>We frequently hear of devices that appear to have high levels of discards 
 and/or errors. They are usually orange on the map, and the status window 
 shows a message like this:</p><pre class="code">Reason: Discards = 738: [1] sc0
</pre>
            <p><a name="kanchor3447"></a><a name="kanchor3448"></a>The most likely reason that InterMapper shows a high rate of discards 
 from a device is that the device is actually reporting these errors. It's 
 common that when InterMapper reports errors (from its SNMP queries), the 
 manufacturers' own monitoring tools will report zero errors. (It's also 
 normal that the affected devices are operating normally, without problems, 
 in this state.)</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3449"></a>Experiments and Workarounds:</p>
            <ol>
                <li value="1"><a name="kanchor3450"></a><a name="kanchor3451"></a>Use the vendor's own network monitoring tool (by 
 telnetting in, using a web browser, etc.) to see if errors are being reported 
 through the native management interface. It's possible that there actually 
 <i>is </i>a problem. 
  
	
	</li>
                <li value="2">This may be a bug in the SNMP 
 implementation of the device. You can check with your vendor to see if there's 
 a firmware upgrade that addresses the problem. 
  
	
	</li>
                <li value="3"><a name="kanchor3452"></a><a name="kanchor3453"></a>To test InterMapper's accuracy, use another SNMP console 
 to check out the particular MIB variables for the device. InterMapper 
 monitors the <span class="code"><a name="kanchor3454"></a>ifInDiscards</span> and <span class="code">ifInErrors</span> MIB variables (and the corresponding <span class="code"><a name="kanchor3455"></a>ifOutxxxx</span> variables) listed on the         <a href="../09-Reference/09-02-Probe_Reference/probes.html#polledvars">Network and Server 
 Probes</a> page to compute its error &amp; discard figures. 
	
	<p>You can monitor these same variables with your 
 SNMP Console to see if the same errors are reported there.</p></li>
                <li value="4">Run a ping test through the device that's reporting the errors. 
	
	<ul><li value="1">If packets are actually being 
 discarded, you'll see a higher than normal packet rate of dropped packets. 
    
		
		</li><li value="2"><a name="kanchor3456"></a><a name="kanchor3457"></a>If packets aren't being dropped, it's another 
 clue that the values reported by SNMP are incorrect.</li></ul></li>
                <li value="5"><a name="kanchor3458"></a><a name="kanchor3459"></a>As a workaround, if you've satisfied yourself that 
 the error reports are bogus, you can instruct InterMapper to ignore the 
 discards and/or errors. To do this, Get Info on the affected device and 
 check the "Ignore Interface Errors" or "Ignore Interface 
 Discards" box as desired.</li>

            </p>
            <h2>What does it mean when InterMapper says a "subnet mask is discontiguous"?</h2>
            <p><a name="kanchor3460"></a><a name="kanchor3461"></a>In usual network configurations, a device's subnet mask contains one 
 bits in the left side of the number, and zero bits on the right. InterMapper 
 can then use the convention that a subnet mask is described as the number 
 of bits in the subnet mask, and uses the notation of "/24" to 
 indicate a subnet mask of 24 one-bits, or "255.255.255.0". For 
 more details, see the <a href="ipaddressing.html#subnets">IP Addressing 
 FAQ.</a></p>

            </p>
            <p>A subnet mask that has zero bits interspersed with the one bits in the left half of the value is often 
 a configuration error. InterMapper points this out when you click and 
 hold on a link: the status window resembles the figure at the right. 
</p>
            <p>Normally, the address line contains the IP address and the subnet mask. 
 This example shows a device whose IP address and subnet mask are set to 
 the same value. This error is shown in the status window.</p>
            <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.online"><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

            <h2>Why do network labels sometimes have a "/2*"?</h2>
            <p class="floatright">
                <img style="WIDTH: 158px;BORDER-TOP-STYLE: none;BORDER-RIGHT-STYLE: none;BORDER-LEFT-STYLE: none;HEIGHT: 88px;BORDER-BOTTOM-STYLE: none;" height="88" src="../Resources/Images/hpprinter.gif" width="158" border="0" />
            </p>
            <p>This is another indication 
 that there's a problem with the subnet mask. The figure at the right shows 
 the network oval with a discontiguous subnet mask. The <b>/2*</b> indicates 
 that the subnet mask has zero bits in the left half; clicking on the link 
 will give a status window similar to the one above. </p>
            <p>This example comes from an HP printer that has a bug in its SNMP implementation. 
 The subnet mask of the printer is actually configured properly, and the 
 printer is working. However, the SNMP software in the printer is reporting 
 the incorrect value (it's reporting the IP address) for the subnet mask. 
 Help/Systems has reported this to HP.</p>

            <p><a name="kanchor3462"></a>Examine the network's Status window  to determine 
 whether the subnet masks are the same in both ovals. If the subnet masks 
 are different, one of the devices connected to the oval with the "wrong" 
 subnet mask probably has a misconfigured subnet mask. (Look for the device 
 that is being polled with SNMP.)</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3463"></a>Note: For devices polled with ICMP echoes, InterMapper tries to guess 
 whether it should draw a link to the network that contains the IP address. 
 If both network ovals look equally good, it may draw a link to the "wrong" 
 one, or alternate between them.</p>

            <h2>Some network ovals have more than one IP network number...</h2>
            <p><a name="kanchor3464"></a>It's possible for a router or host to have two or more configured IP 
 addresses for a particular interface. This form of secondary IP addressing 
 can be common if your addressing is in transition. Rather than bringing 
 everything to a halt to change IP addresses, a network administrator will 
 support two IP subnets on the same logical wire. All the devices in the 
 subnet can then have their IP addresses changed at their leisure, rather 
 than forcing everyone to change them all at once. When all the addresses 
 have changed, the administrator usually gets rid of the old network number.</p>
            <p>It's also possible that InterMapper is only reporting what it knows, 
 and the information it is using is incomplete. This may be true of multi-point 
 network technologies (like frame-relay clouds). If you find a situation 
 where InterMapper is reporting multiple networks on a logical network 
 and you know it's wrong, please send us email (<a href="mailto:support@intermapper.com">support@intermapper.com</a>) 
 so we can figure out a way to make InterMapper's depictions more accurate.</p>
            <p>We would also like to hear about a network with multiple IP network 
 numbers where InterMapper does not show them correctly.</p>

            <p><a name="kanchor3469"></a><a name="kanchor3470"></a><a name="kanchor3471"></a>It is a normal situation for VLANs. InterMapper first traverses the

            <!-- h2>Why doesn't InterMapper find AppleTalk networks?</h2>

<p>To learn about AppleTalk networks, InterMapper asks SNMP-managed devices for 
  the list of ports from their AppleTalk MIB. If the router does not support the 
  AppleTalk MIB, InterMapper does not display the AppleTalk network numbers even 
  if the device routes AppleTalk. Check the version number of the routing software 
  and the router documentation to see if it supports the AppleTalk MIB.</p>

            <p><a name="kanchor3475"></a>This problem is related to having only one "target" address 
 for each device, even though InterMapper knows the addresses of the other 
 ports. When a device is discovered using TCP/IP, it gets added with a 
 target address in IP. You can't switch to use RTMP because that's an AppleTalk-only
