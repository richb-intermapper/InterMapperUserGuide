            <h2>What is SNMP?</h2>
            <p><a name="kanchor3568"></a><a name="kanchor3569"></a>SNMP stands for the Simple Network Management Protocol. At its heart, 
 SNMP is a set of rules that allows a computer to get statistics from another 
 computer across the Internet.</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3570"></a>Computers keep track of various statistics that measure what they're 
 doing. For example, routers can keep track of the number of bytes, packets, 
 and errors that were transmitted and received on each interface (port). 
 Web servers might keep a tally of the number of hits they have received. 
 Other kinds of equipment have configuration information that's available 
 through SNMP.</p>
            <p>Each of these pieces of information (packet statistics, page hits, configuration) 
 is kept in a database described by a <i><a name="kanchor3571"></a>Management Information Base</i> 
 (a            <i>MIB</i> in SNMP parlance.) There are a many different MIBs, describing 
 many different aspects of a computer's operation.</p>
            <p>The various values that can be retrieved from a MIB are called <i>MIB 
 variables</i>. These variables are defined in the MIB for a device. Each 
 MIB variable is named by an            <i><a name="kanchor3572"></a>Object Identifier</i><a name="kanchor3573"></a><a name="kanchor3574"></a><a name="kanchor3575"></a> (OID), which usually 
 has a name in the form of numbers separated by periods ("."), 
 like this: 1.3.6.1.xxxx.x.x.x.x...</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3576"></a><a name="kanchor3577"></a>For example, the MIB-II (pronounced, "MIB two") has a variable 
 that indicates the number of interfaces (ports) in a router. It's called 
 the "ifNumber", and its OID is 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3578"></a><a name="kanchor3579"></a><a name="kanchor3580"></a>InterMapper can query a device for the MIB variables and display the results. 
 When a device receives a SNMP Get-Request for this ifNumber OID, it responds 
 with the count of interfaces.</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</b> The trailing ".0" 
 in the example above is technically part of the OID. Although you will 
 often see OIDs written without it, InterMapper requires that it be present 
 wherever you enter an OID.</p>
            <p><a name="rocs"></a>
            </p>
            <h2><a name="kanchor3581"></a>What is the 'Read-only Community String'?</h2>
            <p><a name="kanchor3582"></a><a name="kanchor3583"></a><a name="kanchor3584"></a><a name="kanchor3585"></a>The SNMP Read-Only Community String is like a password. It is sent along 
 with each SNMP Get-Request and allows (or denies) access to device. Most 
 network vendors ship their equipment with a default password of "public". 
 (This is the so-called "default public community string".) Many 
 network administrators will change the community string to keep intruders 
 from getting information about the network setup. This is a good idea. 
 Even if it's only read-access, SNMP can divulge a lot of information about 
 the network that could be used to compromise it.</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3586"></a><a name="kanchor3587"></a><a name="kanchor3588"></a>If there's a "read-only community string", you might expect 
 that there is a"Write community string". You'd be correct. There 
 is also a SNMP Set-Request, which is a command to set certain SNMP MIB 
 variables (e.g., certain OIDs) to a specified value. These writes are 
 protected by the write community string (which should <i>never</i><a name="kanchor3589"></a><a name="kanchor3590"></a> be 
 set to 'public'!). Many SNMP-speaking devices also have IP address filters 
 that ignore requests (read and write) unless the source address is on 
 an access list.</p>
            <p><a name="kanchor3591"></a><a name="kanchor3592"></a>There's also a SNMP Trap, which is an unsolicited message from a device 
 to an SNMP console (for example, InterMapper) that the device is in an 
 interesting state. Traps might indicate power-up or link-up/down conditions 
 temperatures exceeding certain thresholds, high traffic, etc. Traps provide 
 an immediate notification for an event that might otherwise be discovered 
 only during occasional polling.</p>

            </p>
            <h2>Why can't I get SNMP information from a device?</h2>InterMapper requires that SNMP be available and configured to display traffic 
 information. The most common cause of not being able to see traffic is 
 that you haven't entered the SNMP Read-only community string. (This is 
 like a password that controls whether another computer can retrieve SNMP 
 information.) 

<p>In order of simplest to most complex, here is a list of reasons that 
 InterMapper might not get SNMP information from a device:</p><ul><li value="1"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor3593"></a>Wrong DNS name/IP address</b> 
 - (not likely, but we have to mention it) </li><li value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;">No connectivity</b> 
 - Can you ping the device from InterMapper? </li><li value="3"><b style="font-weight: bold;">No SNMP agent on the 
 device</b> - Many devices or computers have optional SNMP capabilities 
 that must be installed separately. </li><li value="4"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor3594"></a><a name="kanchor3595"></a>Is the SNMP agent disabled?</b> 
 - Many devices allow you to disable the SNMP capability totally, or from 
 certain ports. </li><li value="5"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor3596"></a><a name="kanchor3597"></a>If the SNMP agent is 
 based on net-snmp or UCD-snmp package</b><a name="kanchor3598"></a><a name="kanchor3599"></a> - be sure that the configuration 
 file specifically lists InterMapper's IP address/subnet as an allowed 
 client </li><li value="6"><b style="font-weight: bold;">In a custom probe, 
 have you specified the OID properly?</b> - (See the            <a href="#oidformat">OID 
 Format FAQ</a> for details.) </li><li value="7"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor3600"></a>Wrong Community string</b> 
 - (have you tried 'public' ?) </li><li value="8"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Access lists: does 
 the equipment only allow SNMP access from certain addresses? </b></li><li value="9"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="kanchor3601"></a><a name="kanchor3602"></a><a name="kanchor3603"></a>Firewalls: does a firewall 
 block the SNMP port between your Mac and the equipment?</b></li><li value="10"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Bugs in the SNMP agent 
 on the equipment</b><a name="kanchor3604"></a><a name="kanchor3605"></a> - InterMapper uses SNMP Get-Next-Requests in several 
 places. We've seen certain equipment that fails when queried this way. 
 </li></ul><p>If you're sure that you've checked all these things and you still can't 
 get SNMP information, please get back to us at <a href="mailto:support@intermapper.com">support@intermapper.com</a>. 
 We may have some tricks up our sleeves. (Or we may wind up learning something!)</p><p data-mc-conditions="Primary.online"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p><p><a name="oidformat"></a></p><h2>How can InterMapper query a particular MIB variable?</h2><p>There are two kinds of MIB variables: scalar values and table entries. 
 </p><ul><li value="1"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Scalars </b>have a 
 single value, such as the interface number shown above. For example, the <span class="code">ifNumber</span> MIB variable of a router is 
 a single number that represents the total number of its interfaces (ports). 
 </li><li value="2"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Table values</b><a name="kanchor3606"></a>, on 
 the other hand, provide the same pieces of information for different items, 
 such as the traffic for each of a router's ports, or information about 
 each of the TCP connections in a device.</li></ul><p>InterMapper can read and display both scalar variables and table variables 
 in its custom SNMP probes.</p><p>Scalar values must have a ".0" suffix in their OIDs. For example, 
 the OID for <span class="code">ifNumber</span> in MIB-II is often 
 written as "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1". In custom probe files, it should 
 be represented as "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0". (This ".0" 
 is technically part of the OID - it's convenient not to write it, though.)</p><p>Table variables are generally suffixed with the index of the row. (This 
 isn't always true: see the note below). For example, the Cisco Environment 
 Monitoring MIB defines two variables for the input air temperature and 
 input voltage as the first rows in each of these tables:</p><pre class="code">ciscoEnvMonTemperatureStatusValue 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.3.1.3
ciscoEnvMonVoltageStatusValue 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.13.1.2.1.3
</pre><p>If you add a suffix ".1" to each of these, you'll get the 
 value of the first row; add ".2" to as a suffix, you'll get 
 the second row, etc.</p><h2><a name="tableix"></a>Do all tables have an index?</h2><p>As noted above, some tables don't have a separate index column. These 
 rows are named (their OIDs are specified by) data in the row. For example, 
 the OID for <span class="code"><a name="kanchor3607"></a>tcpConnState</span> row, the status 
 of a particular TCP connection is "1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.1". Its 
 index is the source and destination IP address and port (all four values) 
 which are appended to the <span class="code">tcpConnState</span> 
 OID. Thus, the full OID for the state of a TCP connection from 9.8.7.6 
 port 543 to 123.45.67.89 port 8765 would be:</p><pre class="code">1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.1.9.8.7.6.543.123.45.67.89.8765</pre><p data-mc-conditions="Primary.online"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p><h2 class="pagebreakbefore"><a name="snmprefs"></a>Where can I read more information about SNMP?</h2><p>Here's a great site to start learning about MIBs and all the cool things
